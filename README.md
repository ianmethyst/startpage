# ianmethyst's startpage

![Desktop screneshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianmethyst/startpage/master/screenshot.png)

This is my not-so-fancy startpage. I made using markdown and [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark). It has a simple table with some links I use frequently.

To update the packages, compile and preview it, use:

```bash
npm install && npm run build && npm run serve
```

I'm using [Trello](https://trello.com/) to stop being a mess, so in the first line there's a giant link to a board of mine.
